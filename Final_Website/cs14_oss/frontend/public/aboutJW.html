    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="bio">
      My name is Jack West, and I from a small town in northern Wisconsin named Bruce. Currently,
      I am a junior cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO. I am studying Cyber
      Science. Upon graduation, I hope to commission and serve as a Cyberspace Operations office. Currently, I am a
      member of Cadet Squadron 14, assined to work as an element leader mentoring a group of six freshmen and
      sophomore cadets.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">
      In my free time, I enjoy golfing and playing my guitar. I am also going to start snowboarding again this
      semester. I grew up snowboarding and skiing, but I have never done it here in Colorado. When the
      weather cooperates, I like playing golf at Eisenhower Golf Club just a few miles down the road from
      my dorm. I started playing guitar about a year and a half ago, when I bought my first acoustic. I play
      country music the most, but I enjoy all kinds of music. I'm currently trying to get my first electric
      guitar. Being a left-handed player, it's difficult to find cheap, affordable guitars without having to
      buy offline.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">
      I am lucky to have traveled to many states and national parks growing up (41 of them!). My favorite
      places that I've ever visited are the Redwood forests in northern California, Glacier National Park
      in Montana, and the Florida Keys. Some of my favorite memories growing up were taking roadtrips with my
      family or just my Dad and I. I hope to visit the rest of the 50 states in my lifetime and see as many
      national parks as I can. I also hope to travel internationally one day.
