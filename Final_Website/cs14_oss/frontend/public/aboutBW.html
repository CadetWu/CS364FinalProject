      I am Brendan Kong-Un Wu hailing from Elkhart, Indiana. I am a Cyber Science Major with a Chinese Minor
      and hopefully don't get kicked out of intramural volleyball because AD doesn't like the sport.

    <h4 class = "moreAboutMe">
      I am half Taiwanese and half Laos. I came to the academy initially for free school
      and the opportunity to be an officer however now I am pursuing my childhood dream of flying as well as the opportunity to lead people.
      Some hobbies of mine include exercising, rock climbing, driving, being a dope friend, and playing on my computer. I am fortunate to be 
      able to pursue all of these hobbies while I am here.
